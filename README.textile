An (incomplete) implementation of XPath 1.0 in Objective-C/Cocoa. 

This is a port of Saxon 6.5 (Java) by Michael Kay.

The XPath 1.0 parser is based on ParseKit - www.github.com/itod/parsekit

What's done?

- The XPath 1.0 parser is complete and functional. 

- Much of the XPath 1.0 language is implemented. There are unit tests for all completed language features. 

- So currently this is basically an ObjC implementation of a simple XPath-like expression language. Includes support for strings, booleans, floating point numbers and functions (including a small standard function library).

What's missing?

- Path expresssions. Yeah, the most interesting part of XPath.


Some example expressions that currently work (i.e. they are parsed, execute, and return a result):

<pre>
boolean(false() != true())

not(string-length('foo') = 1)

substring('12345', 2, 3)

substring-before('1999/04/01', '/')
</pre>
